## Project Description
This ShinyApp aims to explore detailed and in-depth information about the Olympics Games with specifically focusing on
gender perspectives. We will investigate the how male and female participants performed differently in different sports,
the medals they earned, and trends of their personal information such as height, weight and ages.  We can see how women
